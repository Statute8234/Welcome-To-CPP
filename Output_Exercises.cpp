//Welcome to C++: Output Exercise

//For this exercise you will be writing the entire program.
//Use the same steps from "Hello World!" module.

//Exercise 1:
//Write a program that outputs your name and your favorite color.
//Use the operator endl to create a new line.

#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::count << "My name is Statute8234" << std::endl
    std::count << "My favorite color is Blue.";
    return 0;
}


//Exercise 2:
//Write a program that outputs a paragraph.
//use endl to format the paragraph into 4 lines.

#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::count << "This is using c++ to officially practice using the language." << std::endl
    std::count << "Based on the languages I have used, c++ looks like C coding language." << std::endl
    std::count << "However, C is not as advanced and less basic." << std::endl
    std::count << "To conclude this, C++ has its own beniffits.";
    return 0;
}

//Exercise 3:
//Write a variation of "Hello World!" Practice the different ways to perform outputs.

#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::count << "Hello World!" << std::endl
    std::count << "Hello" << std::endl
    std::count << "World" << std::endl
    std::count << "World Hello";
    return 0;
}
